# Prev-leak-AI
We trying to build an AI that can predict geyser faults based on 1.corrosion condition such as water quality (PH levels),Poor design,poor installation,operational issues.2.time.3.history of faults and the number of users per geyser.we need help to code an algorithm that can use corrosion calculation formula which we are struggling to get right.
